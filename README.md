# Confetti-Cuisine-Final-Project-vketh1

In this repository, I even have enforced the ultimate delivery of the Confetti-Cuisine project within which I even have gone over Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, and JSON with some front-end web-based technologies.

To run this project into your system, please transfer this repository and follow the below steps that show a way to install EJS and specific into your system. together with that, I even have deployed this project in Heroku Cloud Platform victimization my GitHub repository and therefore the link of this project is here: https://confetti-cuisine-finalp-vketh1.herokuapp.com/

  In this confetti cuisine, we've dilated the site's capabilities to incorporate "cuisine-based cookery vacations" that revolve around learning to cook varied food designs by leisure whereas attending the change of state categories hosted by well-known native chefs, each within the USA and abroad.
  client interface for these new offerings ought to appear as if and perform just about specifically just like the current setup for the native course offerings which exist already. There ought to be a parallel set of vacation package views, routes, API endpoints, and a genus Herpestes schema model even as with the native courses.

## New added/updated pages:
> This project has completely different pages like
> 1. Home Page
> 2. Courses Page(given in unit 8)
> 3. NEW: "Culinary Vacations" (newley extra for enhancement)
> 4. Contact Page (given in unit 8)

  On each page, there's a header that shows the title of the website, home, courses, cookery vacations, contact page, users, and therefore the latest courses. A navigation bar that shows the 5 completely different pages with their classes.
***Home page contains*** the main points of the merchandise, product page contains all the main points of the product with costs, concerning pages, has the main points of the web site and make contact with the page has the extra data.
Added a replacement button to the most navbar with the title "NEW: "Culinary Vacations" to the present home page. I additionally place a picture and a few texts on the house page with an outline of this new feature. This new button can send you to a replacement page with vacation packages.
***NEW: "Culinary Vacations***
Here area unit the new/updated pages: an internet site wherever you'll be able to describe new cumin these area units actual replicas of the course's practicality. 
To make these websites operate properly, you will need to construct the new vacation theme genus Herpestes model for the MongoDB vacation assortment, update the app's connected route handling, edit its various controller, and, of course, develop the new EJS read templates that correspond to the new pages. ary vacation package, an internet site that shows a listing of all the packages that area unit presently offered, a page that displays the specifics of a particular vacation, associate degreed links to associate degree writing page that enables you to fully delete {the vacation|the vacation} package from the information and a page that enables you to change the main points of an existing holiday.
To limit the alternatives a user will build once interacting with the forms, consider HTML kind parts like choose choices, dropbox, or the hypertext mark-up language information list tag. These would be notably valuable within the fields of departure location and culinary art.
supplied a "seed vacations.js" module supported the one that seeded the course assortments from the textbook project it'll erase all current documents from the vacations collection before executing the insertions when you execute it with "node seed vacations."
*If we would like to edit or take away the culinary art description, we tend to should initial log in.*
***courses*** extra a replacement button to form New cookery Vacation Package that takes to the edit page.
users and therefore the latest courses stay constant.

  I want to tell you that aside from developing a cooking vacation package module with making, viewing, update and deleting vacation packages, I even have completed 2 additional credit tasks for obtaining additional points within the assignment delivery.
  # Extra Credit 1:
  I valid the shape during which they come back date should come back when the departure date. I used JavaScript (getTime) date comparison practicality to match each date. If the departure date is bigger than the come backdates, an associate degree alert is formed that displays a blunder message.
 # Extra Credit 2:
  solely attested and logged-in users will produce, update and delete cooking vacation packages. However, for viewing details of cooking vacation packages, there's no have to be compelled to login into the system. I created a variable known as loggedIn that checks whether or not a user is attested or not. By the if-else loop, I even have enforced this feature.
